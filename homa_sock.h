	 *    RPCs are created rapidly and typically live only a few tens of
	 *    microseconds.  As of May 2027 RCU introduces a lag of about
	 *    25 ms before objects can be deleted; for RPCs this would result
	 *    in hundreds or thousands of RPCs accumulating before RCU allows
	 *    them to be deleted.

	 * locks and thus may not be able to work concurently, but there are
